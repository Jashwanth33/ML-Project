Fraud detection in Healtth sector Using Auto-ML
Fraud detection plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the integrity and financial
 sustainability of healthcare systems, particularly in billing and claims management.
 Traditional rule-based mechanisms and manual oversight often struggle to identify
 complex and evolving fraudulent activities, resulting in inefficiencies and financial
 losses. It addresses these challenges by introducing an advanced fraud detection sys
tem based on the Random Forest algorithm, a robust machine learning technique.
 The proposed system efficiently analyzes healthcare claims data, identifies patterns,
 and classifies claims as legitimate or fraudulent with improved accuracy and adapt
ability. By leveraging machine learning, the system reduces manual effort and en
hances fraud detection rates while offering real-time alerts and user-friendly data
 visualization. The expected outcomes include increased detection accuracy, opera
tional efficiency, and actionable insights for decision-makers. Looking to the future,
 the project can be expanded to integrate hybrid machine learning algorithms, support
 larger datasets, and incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms to counteract emerg
ing fraud trends, making it a scalable and enduring solution for combating healthcare
 billing fraud.
